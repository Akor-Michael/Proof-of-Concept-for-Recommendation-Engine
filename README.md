# DealDay Recommendation System

Welcome to the DealDay Recommendation System repository. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of AI and data-driven recommendation systems for DealDay, an innovative e-commerce platform in Nigeria. While DealDay's proprietary data is not available for this proof of concept, we have strategically utilized open-source data from Amazon and Home Depot to simulate real-world scenarios. Our goal is to showcase how AI-driven recommendation systems can enhance user experiences and boost sales on the DealDay platform.

## Introduction

DealDay's success as a leading e-commerce platform in Nigeria relies on offering customers personalized and relevant product recommendations. To achieve this, we have explored and implemented three distinct recommendation systems:

## Methods

### Product Popularity Based Recommendation System

**Method:** This approach analyzes user ratings to identify popular products and tailor recommendations based on overall popularity.

**Advantages:**
- Quickly identifies products with high customer engagement.
- Tailors recommendations based on overall popularity.
- Particularly helpful to new customers who have no purchase history.

### Model-Based Collaborative Filtering System

**Method:** Utilizing collaborative filtering and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to establish user-product correlations.

**Advantages:**
- Provides personalized recommendations by finding hidden patterns.
- Offers suggestions based on user interactions and preferences.
- Effective even for new users with limited purchase history.

### Text-Based Clustering Recommendation System

**Method:** This system clusters products using TF-IDF and K-Means based on textual descriptions.

**Advantages:**
- Considers contextual relevance through textual information such as product descriptions.
- Offers targeted recommendations based on product characteristics rather than popularity.
- Enhances user engagement and discovery of relevant deals.

## Deployment Strategy and Implementation

Integrating these recommendation methods into DealDay's platform harnesses the power of AI and data-driven insights. Our deployment strategy includes data collection, model implementation, product integration, and continuous feedback for improvement. By embracing AI and data-driven insights, DealDay aims to enhance the customer shopping experience and solidify its position as one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Nigeria.
